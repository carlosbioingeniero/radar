It has been an important stepping stone in making it easier to adopt microservices at scale. It offers discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling. It provides these cross-functional capabilities without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or baking libraries into each service. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes, aka sidecars, deployed alongside each service process in a separate container. Sidecars intercept the inbound and outbound traffic of each service and provide cross-functional capabilities mentioned above. This approach has relieved the distributed service teams from building and updating the capabilities that the mesh offers as code in their services. This has lead to an even easier adoption of polyglot programming in a microservices ecosystem.

Simply, it is about the number of retries that an application can execute in order to obtain the expected response for a request. In order for the pattern to be used successfully, the retries must be able to be configured a certain number of times. It is useful when there are network problems, internal errors of the consumed server, because there are no responses or they are very slow. It is useless if the component to consume is overloaded with requests. In Bancolombia, the Retry pattern is not applied alone, it is done in conjunction with **Circuit Breaker**. It is often useful for some operations that use Retry to be idempotent. **Idempotency** is a property used in mathematics and computer science, where certain operations can be applied multiple times without changing the result after the first interaction. It is applied in scenarios where the client can make retries on the request and where these can generate untimely changes or damage. Apply Idempotence preferably in relevant operations, as this operation can add latencies, so it is not recommended in all operations. This can be done through the use of **idempotence http headers**.

At Bancolombia we have it and this is Kubernetes. In this case, the same tool that orchestrates the containers in the Cloud cluster is the one that acts as the curator of the deployments. The native Kubernetes container orchestrator capabilities make this possible, without requiring additional use of other Kubernetes capabilities. This is achieved with the proper configuration of the **deployment.yaml** file. However, it is possible to optimize this task with the use of the Kubernetes probes (Liveness and Readiness), thus favoring high availability and responsiveness of the applications.

It steers you towards an effective use of layers of abstraction  helps your tests capture the business vernacular  and encourages good testing and software engineering habits.\\nInstead of focusing on low-level interface-centric interactions you describe your test scenarios in a similar way you\\'d describe them to a human being - an actor in Screenplay-speak. You write simple\t readable and highly-reusable code that instructs the actors what activities to perform and what things to check. The domain-specific test language you create is used to express screenplays - the activities for the actors to perform in a given test scenario.",
